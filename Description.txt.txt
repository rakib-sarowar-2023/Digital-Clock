In JS created a function called updateClock() that gets the current time using 
the Date() object, formats the time into hours, minutes, and seconds, 
and then displays the formatted time in the clock element.

updateClock() function called once to initialize the clock, 
and then use the setInterval() method to update the clock every second.
